# Bad Apple!! in Sonic CD
Yup. I have gone insane again. I put Bad Apple in Sonic CD (well, Palmtree Panic Act 1 only, really, but still).

## How To Build
Just provide the original CD files in the _Original folder for the region you want, and run ".Make.bat"

## Notes
Yes, it lags. Transferring a whole tilemap into VRAM is pretty intensive, especially when done very often. Not much I can really do without refactoring how Sonic CD works.
